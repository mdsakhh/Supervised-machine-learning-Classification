Project: Supervised machine learning : Classification
Classification Dataset
Objective of this machine learning classification projects:
The main objective of this classification project is to fitting different machine learning classification models to evalaute the performance of the models in classifying the breast cancer dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository
Breast cancer dataset: This dataset consists of information about breast cancer tumors, including features such as size and shape, and labels indicating whether the tumor is benign or malignant. It is often used to train models that predict the likelihood of a tumor being malignant.
Description of the Data
Features: The dataset includes 10 features that describe the characteristics of the breast cancer tumors, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area. These features are computed from a digitized image of the breast mass, and are all numeric values.
Labels: The dataset includes a label for each data point, indicating whether the tumor is benign (labeled as "B") or malignant (labeled as "M").
Number of data points: The breast cancer dataset includes 569 data points.
Source: The breast cancer dataset was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, a physician at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, and was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
